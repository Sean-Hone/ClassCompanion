# ClassCompanion
This project is a simple app to help manage my studies. It will allow a user to add infomration about their course
making it easily accessible. It will also calcualte helpful information on a course such as current grade or percentage
through course. I am using this app as a way of solidifying my own research into learning android application programming.

So far I have implemented: 

Project has a home page with grid view of mock courses. Clicking an item takes you into that classes information screen. The class name is the changed to the title and you can swipe through or select each tab. At this point each tab is an empty weighting fragment.
  
In the future I wish to implement:

Home Page: This will be a grid layout of all the classes the user is taking. Each tile will show class name and possibly current grade in course and reference to how far through course they are. Will have a floating action button to add courses and a settings button in top right of menu
  
Class Page: Each class page will have a tab layout to select directly or swipe between. The three tabs will be the weighting info of the course, current progress and helpful/important links and info. Navigation menu can be accessed from button on toolbar and comes over top of the current class info screen. Navigation menu header has info on this class and menu items will be buttons to get directly to another calss info screen or to home page.
    
Weighting Tab: Will show a pie chart of what each component of the course will be equal to. Below that will be a scroll view of the key of the pie chart showing a percentage value aswell.
  
Helpful Links Tab: Link to course homepage, Lecturer/course coordinators name and email, Course description, Mandatory course requirements
  
Current Progress Tab: Shows a representation of grade in course so far calcualted from all components completed and their values. Shows upcoming assignments or tests and due dates. Allows for calculation of average grade needed to pass with certain grade. Possibly gives access to calender to visualise/keep track of timetable and due dates through semeseter, term, year etc.
