# ClassCompanion
This project is a simple app to help manage my studies. It will allow a user to add infomration about their course
making it easily accessible. It will also calcualte helpful information on a course such as current grade or percentage
through course. I am using this app as a way of solidifying my own research into learning android application programming.

So far I have implemented:
  -The project has been created and set up with github along with an empty homepage activity
  
In the future I wish to implement:

Home Page
  -This will be a grid layout of all the classes the user is taking
  -Each tile will show class name and possibly current grade in course and reference to how far through course they are
  -Will have a floating action button to add courses and a settings button in top right of menu
  
Class Page
  -Each class page will have a tab layout to select directly or swipe between.
  -The three tabs will be the weighting info of the course, current progress and helpful/important links and info
  -Navigation menu can be accessed from button on toolbar and comes over top of the current class info screen
  -Navigation menu header has info on this class and menu items will be buttons to get directly to another calss info screen
    or to home page
    
Weighting Tab
  -Will show a pie chart of what each component of the course will be equal to
  -Below that will be a scroll view of the key of the pie chart showing a percentage value aswell
  
Helpful Links Tab
  -Link to course homepage
  -Lecturer/course coordinators name and email
  -Course description
  -Mandatory course requirements
  
Current Progress Tab
  -Shows a representation of grade in course so far calcualted from all components completed and their values
  -Shows upcoming assignments or tests and due dates
  -Allows for calculation of average grade needed to pass with certain grade
  -Possibly gives access to calender to visualise/keep track of timetable and due dates through semeseter, term, year etc
