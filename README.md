# ClassCompanion
This project is a simple app to help manage my studies. It will allow a user to add infomration about their course
making it easily accessible. It will also calcualte helpful information on a course such as current grade or percentage
through course. I am using this app as a way of solidifying my own research into learning android application programming.

So far I have implemented: 

Project has a home page with grid view of some of my courses. Clicking an item takes you into that classes information screen. The class name is the changed to the title and you can swipe through or select each tab. You can also drag in a drawer style menu from the side to change between the different classes.
  
Class Page: Each class page has have a tab layout to select directly or swipe between. The two tabs currently implemented are the weighting info of the course and current progress. Navigation menu can be accessed from button on toolbar and comes over top of the current class info screen. Navigation menu header has info on this class and menu items are be buttons to get directly to another calss info screen or to home page.

Current Progress Tab: Shows a graph representation of average grade in course so far calcualted from all course components completed and their values. Allows for calculation of average grade needed to pass with certain grade and several other helpful statistics.

Weighting Tab: Shows a pie chart of what each component of the course is equal to. Below that will be a scroll view of the key of the pie chart showing a percentage value aswell.

In the future I wish to implement:
  
Helpful Links Tab: Link to course homepage, Lecturer/course coordinators name and email, Course description, Mandatory course requirements. The ability to add and remove courses and the class data held with in them. More relevant data for a class on the home page.


At the moment the app has come to a standstill as I have been swamped down by school work and trying to learn some web programming skills.
